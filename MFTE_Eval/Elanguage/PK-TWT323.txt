@SyedAhsanAli17 @_Mansoor_Ali @OfficialMahoor @Shoaib_Jatt It’s system’s fault not her which hasn’t provided any facilities to athletes. https://t.co/WeRY9HdaoG


@OfficialMahoor @Shoaib_Jatt What’s your achievement in life except criticising others at least she has represented her country on the grandest stage of sports.


@OfficialMahoor @Shoaib_Jatt Also do you know what was the ranking of her opponent. She is ranked 5th in the world. At least know the fact before commenting.


@omar_quraishi @TheRealPCB is not Govt funded organisation where as PSB has returned Rs. 440 million unused fund to govt question should be asked to POA and PSB about their failures to market other games specially hockey.


@cricketpakcompk Triggered


@Mubeen_Ul_Haq @TheRealPCB is not responsible for the state of other sports it is self funded organisation who get funds from broadcasting deals and sponsorship. @GovtofPakistan is responsible for all this mess.


@SSEHBAI1 I thought you were a good journalist but the language you use today for her is not good. You should delete this tweet. Whether you liked her or not you shouldn’t stoop this level.


@murtazawahab1 @BBhuttoZardari this is really getting out of hand. How long will this go on? Or @ImranKhanPTI is also responsible for all this conversion shit? Are your govt is really powerless to deal  https://t.co/HTci1JVG7s


@dridadahn She survived. Courts are bitches of riches in Pakistan.


So according to you all the animal waste and garbage lifted from Karachi these are the Saturday morning pictures. https://t.co/UHbuZF3Yl0


@sabizak I think you missed the other economic impact of this. Most of the animals are sold by lower tier of the society and also the hides of animals are raw material for leather industry so it’s complement the economic cycle which can improve their economic health...

@omar_quraishi One of the my friend visited there today they were saying only 50-100 will get vaccination shots. @murtazawahab1 can you please comfirm is it true.


@dawn_com Basically he is saying that Karachiites don't vote for PPP that's why we haven't done any work for betterment of Karachi and will not do until we vote for them simple as that.

@murtazawahab1 This is Jhangir Road where sewerage water always present for 365 days. https://t.co/QBWGG0m5nf


@GFarooqi Where were the human rights when you abused your fifteen years old maid?
Practice before what you preach.
BTW you heard about cooler guy he received same backlash and he was man.


@amarguriro This is not the iconic W-11 buses if you have ever seen them they were yellow in colour these are the buses of other different routes which are now running on W-11 route. BTW they should be replaced long ago but  for Karachi city, provincial and federal govt don’t have resources.


@murtazawahab1 Sir if you have read the news carefully invoice date was June 18, 2018 and PTI govt was formed in 2018 August so this may be done in care taker govt.


@gerrys_visa Is it available for all person holding valid visa or only for students?


@Emmad81 It’s a request kindly don’t consider @iramizraja for urdu commentary for @TheRealPCB next event or series.


@KElectricPk 0400027338001. You have shutdown whole area in the name of maintenance on Friday and didn’t even bother to inform us. Way to go 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻


@murtazawahab1 First kindly construct the roads of Karachi and the quality of roads are so unique in Karachi that in 2 months Jhangir road is damage.


@ShumailaPPP @murtazawahab1 Why doesn’t your govt solve the issue of forced conversion of under age girls enough of this gimmickry address the real issue of hindu community.


@PTIKhurshidAlam @AiliaZehra Let me explain you OLT is a public transport project which is for the use of general public where is PA building is for MPA which draw salaries and other perks from taxes. At least OLT can recover it’s partial cost from fares.


@PTIKhurshidAlam @AiliaZehra And where as What MPAs do in PA we have all seen it and you can’t recover even one rupee from them. BTW mostly public transport projects in the world are subsidised.
And what about Peshawar BRT isn’t it subsidised.


@ZahidHussainZah @UsamaKhawar @adeel_azhar That’s not even a food. BTW your world famous food street sucks big time even a smaller bbq seller in Karachi tastes thousands time better than your food street bbq.


@Uzair_Afaq English tabloids who else.


@RePorter1979 @OonibAzam_ @murtazawahab1 He will also getting financial support for running of KMC to dilute the support of PTI and MQM. To show the Karachiites that PPP care which itself is a mirage.


@ZuhairAbbasMir Good to see GoS trying to provide quality health care to people of Sindh. I have just one question why people need to come to Karachi for medical treatment when they can get these medical facilities in cities near them just asking. @murtazawahab1


@junaidmuhammadd There are other festivals too namely rain water flooding, sewerage flooding and potholes festivals 😂😂😂😂

@AmrullahSaleh2 Ever heard of precision guided missiles. Pak uses against India on Feb27 firing from our side of LoC to the Indian Positions. But obviously you needed some thing to hide your incompetence.


@AmrullahSaleh2 Why share evidence in DM when your opening blaming Pakistan for you incompetence. This show you have nothing to show just accusing to hide incompetency.


@AfghanistanDef9 @taahir_khan @AmrullahSaleh2 @ForeignOfficePk BTW all the TTP commanders were killed in Afghanistan after operation 


@MaryamNSharif  problem is that your family is actively involve in politics where as Niazi’s sons are not involved in Pakistan’s politics so there is the problem which you don’t want to understand. And she is rightly annoyed for involving her sons.


@ArslanNaseerCBA  @Humtvnetwork


@AlyHydr @murtazawahab1 @SyedNasirHShah @MuradAliShahPPP Four pictures one is street where is no house is situated , 2 and 3 are main roads and other is bridge where in Karachi people do  and throw animal waste on these places.


@MaryamNSharif This is the level of future PM of Pakistan. You and @ImranKhanPTI has created the most toxic and hate filled political generation where being jew or any other religious minority is . https://t.co/Jk8fUdDaYy


@Jahanzeyb @DrWajidAli18 @OwaisTohid @mirzaiqbal80 @MHasnainPak @TheRealPCB You have to accept that Haris Rauf is bigger  than Imam although Imam have talent he needs to work on his strike rate. Still baffles me why he always get selected ahead of hasnain.

@Natsecjeff that plane is A-10 warthhog only operated by USAF.

@zoo_bear @ZarrarKhuhro @republic Also only USAF uses these planes.


@ZarrarKhuhro It's from some where in UK where people watch USAF F-15 going for loop.


@ThisMyHandle @SAMRIReports @DisinfoEU @BBCWorld @DFRLab And the jet is A-10 warthog which is only used by US


@TOLOnews And when given opportunity to flee the country by land all of them will be making queue at Torkhum and Chamman border.


@IffatHasanRizvi Because they were in power now the power is shifted to Pashtuns so they have started to blame Pakistan. Obviously taking note from their previous masters.


@husainhaqqani @SAMRIReports You are right people of Afghanistan are still living in 1990s.


@BBhuttoZardari @murtazawahab1 have a look another feather in your incompetent government cap👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 https://t.co/l0UgqJteti


@virendersehwag Happy birthday Captain.


@DennisCricket_ Obviously not. Remember when Srilankan's broke the bio secure bubble they were send back. But here Indians attended the book launch without informing the ECB and their coach tested positive during the test no eyes were blinked. Because of BCCI financial power.


@Asad_Umar Please make roads first there are dirt tracks in Karachi for off roading.


Another gem @ZarrarKhuhro https://t.co/CUSbwnWkng

@ZarrarKhuhro But for  we are just like our neighbours FACISTS.


@aftabafridii @RePorter1979 @ImranRiazKhan 😂😂😂 look who’s talking oh  for all blind followers like you the one who talk about issues of common man is .


@TabeshQ Bro you have only Libery  to celebrate where in Karachi there is 5 star chowrangi, Sea view and Bharia Town. Please next time bragging about your energy bring your game upto the level of Karachiites enthusiasm.


@amanalilive @saqib_y1 @TabeshQ La-whore 😂😂😂😂


@mehdirhasan Do some research before blaming Pakistan. Pakistan has hosted large number of Afghan refugees.


@_robpatt This is not a NIC it's a registration card for Pakistani Nationals who are living abroad.


@Umair08293063 @_robpatt My nephew and niece has this card although they are not 18 yet.


@HashTagCricket 😂😂😂 in Pakistan politics India is not even a topic for future PM. Get a life we have more important issues than discussing 🇮🇳. 


@IuYumaan @HashTagCricket Main topic of Pakistan politics corruption, economy, inflation, sexual violence against kids and women even in Azad Kashmir election there is no mention of India. People like you are obsessed with Pakistan not us.


@BakhtawarBZ I think she is talking about  mazar which is in Karachi and Karachi is in Sindh. Also due to Muharram there was a heavy LEA presence in nearby areas of  so it was Police fault which is under the Command of your CM.


@AK_Forty7 @VeqarIslam @PTIofficial @ImranKhanPTI @BBhuttoZardari @murtazawahab1 @MuradAliShahPPP Actually all district central is shambles with overflowing of sewerage, damaged roads and pile of grabage around Siraj ud dola and saifi colleges. And the one haven’t done anything for 13 years are going to change this in 2 years.


@RePorter1979 @shujaat777 @BBhuttoZardari @QaseemSaeed Trip on land cruiser great 🙃🙃🙃


@AlyHydr You are right Karachi Badal  from Cosmopolitan City to ancient city of Mon jo Daro. For 13 years PPP has ruled Karachi and they can't even able to give a public transport system for city. Apart from this what your govt have to show?


@CricWick @babarazam258 @TheRealPCB With the help of umpires.


@bhogleharsha Not every team can win test after 2/3 or 6/41 in first session.


@BBCYaldaHakim @AqilShah_ West is proud of investigative journalism then why they are not able to pin point the locations of safe houses of Taliban in Pakistan. This is just propaganda if US can kill Bin Laden in Pakistan why they haven't done same for so called Taliban Quetta Shura. I rest my case.


@atifthepoet With fake accent and big mansion you can talk about being a house wife. But if there are 5 children and average income of man of the house is less than 15k what should you do?


@footiestatto @swarrimaslam And one has out scored the much younger guy in SeriaA at the age of 36


@murtazawahab1 Thank you sir by lane marking and inaugurations now Karachiites have paved roads, working transport system, clean water, no overflow of gutters and no garbage on roads 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 #KarachiWorks


@BajiPlease This is what we call Lahori syndrome. Karachi is a mutli cultural city where you can meet person from any corner of the Pakistan even world.
BTW at least we don’t call pulao a .


@murtazawahab1 Let’s see what you can do in 2 years which your govt was not able to do in 13 years for Karachi.


@AamnaFasihi @hoflolz Here it is major portion of Karachi taxes is direct taxes which doesn’t include GST and Custom duties. This data is of 2018. In 2019 Karachi’s Jodia  alone has pay more income tax than whole Lahore. Go figure out why we beat our chest  https://t.co/LTYVYHpj1E
