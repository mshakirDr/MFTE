He also claimed nobody was able to solve that till then and if anyone can solve it ,then he or she must announce it before 31/1/2012.The problem and my solution are given below. I am asking everyone to solve it and to post solution here or contact with Mr. Alamgeer Hossain:01920779889



Problem: 



My solution:
Let the number is $100x+10y+z$.So after interchanging first and last digit the number will become $100z+10y+x$.

After subtraction the answer will be ,

$100x+10y+z-(100z+10y+x)$

$=100x-100z+10y-10y-x+z$

$=100(x-z)-100+90+10-x+z$

$=100(x-z-1)+10*9+(10-x+z)$

It means from the right, the digits are $(10-x+z),9$ and $(x-z-1)$

From the first condition we get,

$(x-z-1)+9+(10-x+z)+1=x+y+z$

$\Rightarrow x-x-z+z-1+1+9+10=x+y+z$

$\Rightarrow x+y+z=19$........................................(i)

From second condition,

$10-x+z=(x-z-1)+1$

$\Rightarrow 10-x+z=x-z$

$\Rightarrow 2(x-z)=10$

$\Rightarrow x=z+5$............................................(ii)

From third condition,

$x-z-1=z+1$

$\Rightarrow x=2z+2$...........................................(iii)

From (ii) and (iii),

$z+5=2z+2$

$\Rightarrow 2z-z=5-2$

$\Rightarrow z=3$

After putting value of $z$ into (ii) we find,

$x=z+5$

$\Rightarrow x=3+5$

$\Rightarrow x=8$

After putting value of $x,z$ into (i) we get,

$x+y+z=19$

$\Rightarrow 8+y+3=19$

$\Rightarrow y+11=19$

$\Rightarrow y=8$

So the number is,

$100*8+10*8+3$

$=800+80+3$

$=883$

Ans:$883$.


Solution:
Let $n=(abc)_{10}$

$p=(abc)_{10}-(cba)_{10}=99(a-c)$

If $a-c=1$then $p=99$ contradiction;

So let $p=100q+10m+j$

According to problem:

$j=q+1..(i)$

$c=q-1..(ii)$

$a+b+c=q+m+j+1\Rightarrow b=q+m-a+3$

Now,

$99(a-q+1)=99q+10m+2q+1$ So, $99|10m+2q+1$

Only possible case $10m+2q+1=99$ So, $5m+q=49$ As must be $m\geq 8$ ;$q\in\{ 9,4 \}$.

If $q=9$ then $j=10$ contradiction. Setting values, $q=4,m=9$: ans is 883
Adib, are you sure about the problem and article. Can anyone give any link of that article?  Adib,  do you call him?You should be the first one.....CONGRATZZZZ


What did he say? I am so curious. Was the title "A difficult sum?" In english?


I agree


I also agree with you.Actually I needed only 10 minutes.


The problem and the article is a funny joke......


Thanks.Sorry,I can't give you its link because the online copy of Prothom Alo doesn't publish all the advertisements.


I think all kind of business with education should be banned.


actually, it was not an article, just an advertisement in bangla named  "A difficult sum" .it also included Mr. alamgir hosen's stamp size photo.the advertisement him as the inventor of $3$ triple s problem like this one.as it was an advertisement you can not see in the website.i would post the picture of the column if i had not cut and given it to Adib.



I don't think something like mathematics should be used for business like this.


The problem is actually an exercise and it's super easy. I did it just when I saw it. I don't know what Mr. Alamgir thinks of himself.




I must say, quite lame




			
		
				
			
						


So I'll ask everyone to call Mr. Alamgeer.


Oh, But I just can be that rude because above all I am good shepherd.




26th march,the 1st day of online camp,is likely to finish without any work for me.Cuz i can't understand something as i'm new to it.      

Will someone tell me what has actually happened today? 

What is the meaning of "Reading some theories"?as i can't get it after the whole day....





Read some theories from books, if you have any problem then post here. As you can see, there can't be any conventional class here.



600!


Thnxxxxx........




Congratulations to us!





I have posted the $10000^{th}$ post.Yahoo...


OH         

HOW DID I MISS IT !!!


We are to dominate AOPS. (   )


Good job everyone!Let's post and discuss more about math and make it $100000$!!





Great job  . Keep it up everyone.


We have reached 10,001th post. Yahoo....















Sometimes I post the same solution in AOPS and here.I hope that won't be considered copying.


This is a notice from Avik Roy: if anyone copies a solution/idea of a solution from somewhere else and posts it in this forum, he or she must mention the source.


No that's not copying.


And what if just the similarity between ideas appears? For an example: I solved problem $1$ of $1993$ using Eisenstein's criterion. But later I found that it was like the alternative solution given in IMO compendium. Link of this problem: viewtopic.php?f=17&t=2165


To both of you, I don't get what you are meaning by copying solutions or same ideas. But to make you clear, tell me how many distinct solutions are there for a particular problem? At most 20 or 30, or may be something larger. But when that same problem is solved by at least a hundred people, what can you say? Mustn't the ideas intersect? That is never copying. So, if you are clear to yourself, whatever it looks like, don't care. Otherwise, I don't know what to say. Certainly you can't copy solutions directly, since there are LaTeX issues and some other.


That happens to me the most I think(because most of the problems posted here were solved and may be posted as well by me in AoPS previously). So, that depends on how you are doing.


It is all about self respect . I don't think a person would never just copy a solution and post it here just saying, "I have done this all by myself ." If someone does that, then that is his mentality problem, which is not worth discussing anywhere else.


I totally agree, and that's why I believe nobody simply copies a solution from somewhere. And that's why this notice isn't from me.




We have reached 50 posts mark. Thanks to everyone for posting. However, I find most of the members inactive. I hope that everyone will join.


Hmm, you are welcome.




Count me in


I will be active. One more question: Will any kind of online camp be held? (some discussions on a particular topic and an exam maybe.)


Count me in too 



And,

I'm Interested to start or restart problem solving marathon. But I'm not quite sure how many of you can participate. So those who want to participate and ready to visit those topics at least one time everyday please reply. I'll be grateful to you if you can take the responsibility of the publicity of this message to others and also to other social sites. I want to start or restart the marathons in this week.


Also possible if everyone agrees. I can try to arrange it. But it depends on the number of participants.


Count me Too ..

Test exam  XD


7 active users . Is there anyone else? My test exam has started but still I'm trying to arrange this. So let's take it seriously.


Though I can't burn my "kheta" of Test exam, but I can do it I guess.

ok i'm in to...probably in nt section.





Of course!


I have been unusual for a long time for having no internet connection. But, I think,I am getting back with this.








I am not confident but i'll visit and try those problems


The marathon has started already.

IMO Marathon

Secondary and Higher Secondary Marathon




Not sure if I can participate regularly. there's difficulty about net access. So i'll try to get the problems and to solve them, but I might not be able post any solutions here. I hope that's okay


Can anyone tell me the specifications for secondary group in english..I am going nuts looking for it..since its my first time i dont know much but will be looking forward to the marathon


But specifications for what? You should tell that specifically.


I believe, that is the 'specification' about the class.

And if that is it, for secondary group.......visit yourself




Where do I register myself from? Im in dhaka by the way.


Registration details will be published in Daily Prothom Alo shortly. Keep your eyes on the newspaper for information about registrations.

Okay, I'll begin!



How many (out of 10) did all of you manage to solve?


I solved 9.


I approached it using the cosine law but the equation got really ugly and I stopped. To be honest, I didn't even read all the problems properly. I pretty much solved all of the ones I attempted but I didn't attempt all of them. That is one of my greatest flaws in problem-solving. I tend to give up too easily. I don't stick to problems I don't 'feel like' solving. I really want to break this habit and I know that as long as I don't have persistence, I'm never going to be a good problem solver.



Anyway....this is not a forum for personal issues. So, I'm really sorry. I got carried away.



So no. I didn't solve problem 4.


I tried something like fusing brahmagupta theorem and sine law. But it got me nowhere. @ mursalin


Anyone solved problem no. 4 of day 5?

Well, 

Assume the problem statement is false. Therefore, for $i\neq j$, $a_i\not \equiv a_j\pmod {17}$. So for each $a_i$, we get a different reminder after dividing by $17$. Thus for $18$ numbers, we need $18$ different reminders. But there are only $17$ possible reminders of $\bmod 17$ which is not enough. Hence we get a contradiction. Therefore 'there exist two elements in $S$ whose difference is divisible by $17$'.

Hello Everyone. BDOI (Bangladesh Olympiad in Informatics ) Problems have been posted in IOI Forum. Anyone having any trouble with their solutions, please post there. 



If there is anyone who doesn't know about BDOI, please post as well



Thanks.


I think there should be an OJ or something where people can submit and practice


These problems were not put on any OJ so far.

Until then, people, if they are interested, can discuss here. 

We think, it's better than waiting for an OJ to publish them.










I talked to a few people regarding this matter.

They told me that it might take a while before the divisional problems come out.

You'll probably have to wait till the end of this year. It's just a speculation though.

Nice initiative- I was thinking of asking everyone having bbcode in their signature to change it if possible (a little scraping odd-job)



But you know, even a little time stings (especially now)


And I forgot to mention, people who have BB Codes in their signatures should instantly take action. Most of the time this problem arises not from the content, but from the signature of some person.


As you might have noticed, we are facing a minor header problem regarding BBCodes$^*$. As a result, when these codes are used, different layers of the page overlap one another. And some ugly annoying texts are also placed on the top of the page. This is not a big issue. But it reduces the functionality of the page and some utilities like 'similar topics', 'upload attachment' can't be used for the overlapping.



To prevent this, try not to use BBCodes. Use equivalent latex commands instead. For example, to get the same effect as $$ or $$, use \textbf{} and \textit{} commands, resp. Example:



$\color{green}{\text{\textbf}}\text{{Bold}}\;\Longrightarrow\;\textbf{Bold}$

$\color{green}{\text{\textit}}\text{{Italic}}\;\Longrightarrow\;\textit{Italic}$

$\color{green}{\text{\color}}\text{{red}}\{\color{green}{\text{\text}}\text{{Red Text}}\}\;\Longrightarrow\;\color{red}{\text{Red Text}}$ $\color{green}{\text{\href}}\text{{http://www.example.com/}}\{\color{green ... {Hyperlink}}$
